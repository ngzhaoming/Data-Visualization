# Data Visualization

### About the project
This project features my exploration in data collection, analysis and visualization. I aim to collect data and trends from various sites for different categories and display it on a web-application. The trends for each category will be represented as an animated bar graph. Through the bar graph, it can show how the data has evolved over time for the respective entity.
