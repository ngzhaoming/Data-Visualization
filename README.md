# Data Visualization

### About the project
This project is named Diabolical Database. The database consists of contents from my exploration in data collection, analysis and visualization. I aim to collect data and trends from various sites for different categories and display it on a web-application. The trends for each category will be represented as an animated bar graph. Through the bar graph, it can show how the data has evolved over time for the respective entity.

### About the creator
As a Computer Science student, I am more familiar and proficient in software development as compared to data collection and visualization. However, with big data readily available in the Internet in today's date, I find it intriguing to use this data and present it in an animated bar graph. I also aim to use this side project to fulfill the following goals:
1. Learn how to collect, manage and cleanup the data that are obtained online. This is followed by presenting this data in a way that is easy to understand
2. Familiarize myself with the various data management libraries that are provided in Python. This includes: Pandas, Numpy, Glob and math library which are useful to manage and sort csv file data more efficiently.
3. Improve on my UI, UX and web application proficiency. I aim to create this web application with the use of Angular.

I hope that there will be various topics that will intrigue you and that you can learn a thing or two about the trends based on that topic. Feel free to contact me or post an issue should there be any questions with regards to the project! ðŸ˜„
